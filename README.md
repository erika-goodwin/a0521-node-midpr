### Why did I make this?

I like learning new things and practicing until I understand it. I learned the basics of Node.js and how amazing ejs is at the moment. As a beginner of backend side language, I felt creating the most basic function like CRUD is a must-do project.

### What did I learn from this project?"

I learned the basic structure of Node.js and how to connect MongoDB. I had fun with MongoDB. It is user-friendly and easy to connect yet a very powerful tool!

### Improvement for next time?

I learned MongoDB first, then learned mongoose. This is why I used MongoDB for this project along with Joi schema. For additional practice and a real-world app, I would like to create a project with mongoose. And that is what I did!
